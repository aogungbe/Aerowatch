# Aerowatch
A Django web app that tracks real-time flight data using OpenSky Network's REST API. It is made using Django HTML, Python , CSS and JavaScript.

## To run the program 
All you have to do is open the folder and then open the terminal. Run pip install requests.Then run python manage.py runserver, click on the url and then it would work pretty well from there.

## Sidenote
The API performs best with popular airports like Heathrow or JFK. Some datasets are incomplete which is why a field could say unknown or the airline code couldnt be mapped with the available dataset so it may show unknown (icao code).
